# Data-Analysis-on-the-Video-Games-Industry

This application was developed as part of a Visual Analytics project for the Master in Data Science and Business Analytics program at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. It uses data from [VGChartz](https://www.vgchartz.com/), one of the major websites focused on providing comprehensive data on the video game industry, and provides insights on sales and other gaming related data in the form of visual representations. 

It also uses Amazon reviews data to perform sentiment analysis on user experiences of the latest versions of Playstaion (PS5), Xbox (Xbox SeriesX) and Nintendo (Nintendo Switch).

The raw data used in the application can found in the files folder and the images used are present in the images folder.
